Implementing the features mentioned, especially with a cloud server, is a multi-step process. Here's a high-level overview of how you can achieve this:

### 1. Setting Up a Cloud Server:

**a. Choose a Cloud Provider**:

Popular choices include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. For this example, I'll use AWS's EC2 service.

**b. Launch an EC2 Instance**:

- Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
- Choose EC2 and then "Launch Instance".
- Select an OS. For Ruby applications, you might choose an Ubuntu Server.
- Configure instance details, storage, and tags.
- Configure a security group to allow HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH.
- Review and launch the instance.

**c. Connect to the Instance via SSH**:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-ip-address
```

### 2. Setting Up the Environment:

**a. Update and Install Dependencies**:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install git curl gpg
```

**b. Install RVM (Ruby Version Manager)**:

```bash
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```

**c. Install Ruby**:

```bash
rvm install ruby-latest
```

**d. Install Sinatra**:

```bash
gem install sinatra
```

### 3. Deploying Your Application:

**a. Clone Your Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomasthaddeus/musical-chairs.git
cd musical-chairs
```

**b. Create a Basic Sinatra App** (for demonstration):

```ruby
# app.rb
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  "Hello, World!"
end
```

**c. Run Your Sinatra App**:

```bash
ruby app.rb -o 0.0.0.0
```

Your Sinatra app should now be accessible via your EC2 instance's IP address.

### 4. Enhancing Functionality:

**a. Data Storage with ActiveRecord**:

- Install the necessary gems:

```bash
gem install activerecord sinatra-activerecord rake
```

- Set up a database, create models, and use them in your Sinatra app.

**b. User Authentication with Sorcery**:

- Install the sorcery gem:

```bash
gem install sorcery
```

- Follow the Sorcery documentation to set up user registration, login, and authentication.

**c. API Integration**:

- Use Ruby's `net/http` or the `httparty` gem to fetch data from external APIs and display it in your Sinatra app.

### 5. Secure and Optimize:

**a. Use a Reverse Proxy**: Install and configure Nginx or Apache to serve your app, providing an additional layer of security and optimization.

**b. Set Up SSL**: Use Let's Encrypt to get a free SSL certificate and set it up with your reverse proxy to serve your app over HTTPS.

**c. Database Backups**: Regularly back up your database to cloud storage like Amazon S3.

**d. Monitoring and Alerts**: Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to monitor your server and application performance.

This is a high-level overview, and each step has its intricacies. Depending on your exact requirements and the complexity of your application, you might need to adjust or add steps. If you'd like a deep dive into any specific step or need further assistance, please let me know!
