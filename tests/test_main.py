_summary_

1. **Basic Functionality Tests**:
    - Test each method with a variety of inputs to ensure they produce the
      expected outputs.
    - Test with different numbers of rows, sequences, and widths.

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - Test with an empty hall (no rows).
    - Test with a sequence containing only boys or only girls.
    - Test with all rows having the same width.
    - Test with a sequence longer than the number of available seats.
    - Test with a sequence shorter than the number of available seats.

3. **Invalid Inputs**:
    - Test with negative numbers of rows.
    - Test with non-binary sequences (i.e., sequences containing characters
      other than '0' and '1').
    - Test with mismatched lengths of sequence and width lists.
    - Test with negative or zero widths.

4. **Performance Tests**:
    - Test with a large number of rows and a long sequence to measure the
      performance of each method.
    - Compare the execution times of the different methods to determine which
      is the most efficient.

5. **Consistency Tests**:
    - Ensure that all methods produce the same output for the same input.
    - This can be done by comparing the outputs of the different methods for a
      variety of inputs.

6. **Logging Tests**:
    - Ensure that the logging mechanism works correctly.
    - Check that logs are being written to the correct files.
    - Check that the logs contain the expected information (e.g., results and
      execution times).

7. **Error Handling**:
    - Ensure that the methods handle errors gracefully and log appropriate
      error messages.
    - For instance, when testing invalid inputs, check that the methods don't
      crash and instead log an error.

8. **Concurrency Tests** (if applicable in the future):
    - If there's a possibility of these methods being called concurrently in
      the future, test how they behave under concurrent access. This is more
      advanced and might not be necessary given the current scope, but it's
      something to consider for more complex applications.
